# Adobe Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Adobe Command Line Interface (CLI) is a modular, extendable platform for Adobe solutions to provide command-line functionality for accessing their APIs. The Adobe CLI provides a core set of endpoints and syntax, while Adobe solutions add their own endpoints for specific functionality.
